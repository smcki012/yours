Yours
=====

Yours enables ordinary people to earn money for creating good content. Anybody
can post content for free, and anybody can endorse good content by tipping the
author with bitcoin. With one catch: when you endorse content, you are actually
investing in the content, and get a portion of subsequent payments. Yours
incentivizes people to pay content creators. Not only does the author get paid,
but people that support the author may also profit, encouraging people to find
and support good content.
